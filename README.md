# simple-print-resume-template

An HTML template for creating Software Engineer (SWE) resumes.  Styled to be saved as a PDF.  Designed with Application Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind.

When I last needed to update my resume I decided to move it from a Microsoft Word document into an HTML file.  Some developers hate HTML and probably loathe this idea, but I have found it a pleasant experience.

Things I have enjoyed so far:
* Storing my resume in source control and being able to easily see changes.
* Using branches to hold different versions of my resume crafted for applying to different companies.
* Modifying the resume in my favorite IDE where I feel most at home.
* Extra: You could also easily host your resume via GitHub Pages if you felt so inclined.
